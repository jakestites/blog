    <p>Class is in session!</p> 

    <p>It has been a while since I was in school. I never really cared for it much before, but I am genuinely excited to be learning something new. MakerSquare offers a front-end web development course here in Austin, and I knew I had to give it a try.</p>

    <p>I’ve always been interested in how web pages are made, work, and interact with the audience. I’ve even wanted my own site and have had opportunities to make a buck if I had only known how to do it!</p>

    <p>The Internet is growing… and coding appears to be modern day literacy. I’m still a bit intimidated from some of the code I’ve seen (as it makes no sense), but I am confident I’ll get there one day!</p>

    <p>In the next post I’ll go more into what we did the first week…. just wanted to give some context first!</p>
