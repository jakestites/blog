        <p>Well… it’s the end of the first week of class and we are already building a site.</p> 

        <p>I have been setting up a personal blog with multiple pages. It will have the homepage (index.html) as well as a contact page and an “about me” page.</p>

        <p>In lecture we went over several topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Command line</li>
            <li>The Web & links</li>
            <li>HTML Theory</li>
            <li>We created a GitHub Repo and learned how to commit and push</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The command line stuff is pretty cool… and looks impressive to anyone who happens to see you messing around in there. </p>

        <p>Overall, I learned a lot this week… and will learn more as I finish up the blog. The instructors have been great! I was a little nervous the first day when I saw the size of the class, but when we are coding there are plenty of people to help! Thanks to all the instructors!</p>

        <p>Google is becoming my best friend. Whenever I don’t know…. I just ask my trusty butler Alfred (Mac App) to please do a Google search for whatever it may be that I am looking for!</p>
